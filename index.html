					<!--img class="float-right ml-5 mb-1 rounded-circle shadow-lg" src="images/avatar.jpg" /-->

					<p>Hello!</p>

					<p>I'm Le, and I'm a software engineer.</p>

					<p>I'm a software engineer because I enjoy problem solving,
						happen to have a knack for recognizing patterns,
						and am lazy enough to want to automate everything.</p>

					<p>I have made websites long enough to remember
						the joys of bubbling events up the DOM tree and
						having to write different code for different browsers.
						As my experiences have taken me from
						back-end to front-end to back-end to front-end,
						I've also learned enough programming languages
						to have forgotten more syntax than I remember.
						Thank goodness for internet search, analytical thinking,
						and a memory good enough to remember
						the language I'm currently using. </p>

					<p>Recently, I have forayed into the wild,
						wild world of app development. Working with this
						relatively new, not-yet-as-standardized-as-web system
						makes me feel oddly nostalgic and possibly want to tear
						my hair out at the same time.
						Regardless, learning new things is always exciting.
						And truly, nothing makes one feel as brilliant as when
						finally a solving a problem after banging one's head
						repeatedly on a computer screen. In all seriousness,
						I did graduate from New York University
						with honors for a Bachelor's degree in both
						Math and Computer Science, so I am fully qualified
						to bang my head as needed.</p>

					<p>Working with teams, I've had experience as a team lead
						and once upon a time had Scrum Master certification.</p>

					<p>I am currently working as a
						freelance developer in a dream quest for
						work-life balance.
						Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact</a> me
						if you find yourself with development needs,
						and we'll see if I can help,
						or at the very least,
						point you in the right direction.</p>

					<h2 class="border-bottom border-info mb-3">Projects üíª</h2>
					<p>
						Since all of my in-depth projects were done in-house,
						<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lc-dev?ref=portfolio" target="_blank">Linked<span
								class="fa fa-linkedin"></span></a>
						has a more comprehensive list of my work experience. My <a
							href="https://github.com/LittleCornerDev?ref=portfolio" target="_blank">GitHub<span
								class="fa fa-github"></span></a>
						doesn't have a lot of work viewable with public access
						but does have some sample code snippets and
						a short history of contribution activity from
						recent app dev work that should at least indicate coding/documentation/communication style for
						anyone curious enough.
					</p>

					<p>In any case, here are some notable projects that
						I thought were really interesting and fun to work on: </p>

					<a name="projects-bfx"></a>
					<h3 class="mt-4">
						BFX
					</h3>
					<p class="sub">for <a href="https://www.borderfree.com/" target="_blank">Borderfree</a>,
						with a team, from project creation through maintenance &amp; improvement</p>

					<br />
					<div class="card">
						<div class="card-body">
							<p class="card-text">
							<ul>
								<li>Transforms a merchant's existing website and
									lets customers see all the prices in international
									currency and to forward their shopping cart to
									Borderfree international checkout.</li>
								<li>Accounts for country-specific restrictions, shipping carriers,
									inclusive VATs, as well as both fx rate and
									PriceBook pricing. Implemented either via JavaScript
									import or back-end APIs.</li>
								<li>Built on the AngularJS framework with a NodeJS and Scala back-end, using LESS for
									styling.
								</li>
							</ul>
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br />

					<p>This product won quite a few company Excellence Awards.
						The company was acquired, and the
						product sadly died. It is now only running on <a href="https://www.borderfree.com/#"
							target="_blank">a handful of merchants</a>, such as <a href="https://www.dunelondon.com/"
							target="_blank">Dune London</a>.</p>

					<p>Here's an article about the product from back when it had more merchants:</p>

					<p>The department had been around a long time before I joined the team.
						The team even won an Oscar for their work.
						I came onboard to make the service cross-platform
						(as it was previously only for IE)
						and wrote automation scripts for the publication process.
						Alas, I was there at the end,
						right before the NY department was shut down.
						Here's an old wiki reference to show that it existed:</p>

							<p class="mb-0">Le is awesome to work with! She's a conscientious
								worker who gets things done while being
								a great team player who provides valuable
								insight and guidance to those around her. She
								is a sharp coder who learned Scala, NodeJS, and
								AngularJS in a short amount of time and
								delivered live, business-critical applications
								using these technologies. But what really makes
								her stand out is her attitude towards her job.
								She always brings enthusiasm towards solving
								tough problems, and she will often reach out to
								stakeholders and partners in the organization
								to develop solutions. Stated simply,
								Le puts into practice something I have come to
								believe, that great software is never created
								in a vacuum; it emerges from the interactions
								people have when they are trying to solve a problem.</p>
